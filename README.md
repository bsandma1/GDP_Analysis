# GDP_Analysis
I work through the analysis of a tidy dataset which contains information on six countries from the year 2000 to the year 2015.  The dataset includes information on each country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and life expectancy per year.  The purpose of the analysis is to understand how GDP affects life expectancy.
